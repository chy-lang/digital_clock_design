# digital_clock_design
In this project, I utilized STM32 microcontroller to develop a digital clock, which contains following functions: 
• Obtain the current temperature and humidity via a sensor module with I2C interface;
• Obtain the current date, specific time and other information via an ESP-8266 WIFI module; 
• Display all the information collected on the LCD screen;
• Achieve the function of “inquiry” based on interrupt
The code is based on the template provided by "正点原子". A great amount of modifications were made from the orginal template, due to the incompatibility of hardware equipment with the template.
